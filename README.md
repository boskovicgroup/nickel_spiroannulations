# nickel_spiroannulations
This repository is associated with our disclosure of a method to make indanyl amines and spiroindane pyrrolidines under nickel catalysis. The manuscript is deposited on ChemRxiv and consists of the main text and the supporting information.
The folders in this repository correspond to the main findings in the manuscript and can help others who wish to dig deeper into the data we obtained while working on this project.
There are 4 main folders:
1) OA_activation_energy
2) isomerization
3) parametrization
4) NMR_sdf_files
5) HPLC
6) kinetics

The folder 1 contains the raw and processed files for the determination of activation energy of oxidative addition of two substrates (chloride and bromide) at different temperatures. These data correspond to Figure 4 in the manuscript. The processing of the data is aided through several scripts that are in the "kinetics" folder which are pulled from a different repository.
Folder 2 contains the raw and processed files (calibration and measuerements) for the data in figure 6. 
Folder 3 contains the yields and conditions used for making figure 8. 
Folder 5 contains the data for figure 7. 
Folder 4 contains the assigned NMR spectra of the new compounds prepared in this project. These are either starting materials, products, by-products, or nickel-containing intermediates that we could isolate and characterize.
